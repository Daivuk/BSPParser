# BSPParser
Simple and modern library for parsing the Valve BSP Format.  

This is mainly for use in my other projects like VisTrace, and is acompanied by https://github.com/Derpius/VTFParser.  

Provides complete abstraction from the BSP file format for reading triangulated map faces.  
*Documentation coming soon*
